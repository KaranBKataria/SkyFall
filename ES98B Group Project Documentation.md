## Introduction

This project provides a **satellite orbital decay simulation and a prediction system**, designed to model and predict the trajectory of a satellite (ISEE-3) entering Earth’s atmosphere along an equatorial orbit.

### Primary objectives:

- Assist **users** in setting up the environment, indicate reasonable use cases and how to launch and vary the simulation to produce visualisations.
- Guide **developers** to understand how to extend the functionality for advanced use cases.

### Key package features:

- Configurable orbital decay simulation based on popular physical models and assumptions:
- Spherical Earth, uniform density, constant rotation.
- Time-invariant satellite surface area, non-rotating around any of its axes.
- U.S. Standard Atmosphere 1976 model.
- Isolated system (Earth and satellite).
- Radar-based state estimation using a configurable **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**.

### Limitations & current known issues

- A spherical Earth with uniform density is assumed.
- Assumes constant surface area and a non-tumbling satellite.
- Assumes the drag equation is valid from start to end - does not consider non-continuum effects above 86km.
- Constant radar noise model (no occlusion or range bias).
- EKF-based filtering (prone to numerical instability).
- Uncertainty quantification based on Monte Carlo sampling; computationally expensive for large sample sizes.

## Environment & Dependencies

### Environment setup

To ensure smooth execution and modular usage of the project, please follow the environment setup guidelines below. The system should be compatible across platforms, but this has not been rigorously tested.

---

**Recommended Global Environment**

| Item | Recommended Configuration |
| --- | --- |
| Python Version | Python ≥ 3.10 |
| Operating System | Windows 10/11, MacOS, or Linux |
| Package Manager | `pip` or `conda` |

### Module-wise dependencies

The project is designed with a modular, class-based architecture, allowing individual components (e.g., the simulator, predictor, or visualiser) to be executed or extended independently.

We explicitly state the dependency versions to ensure long-term maintainability, prevent future compatibility issues, and support modular reuse or integration in other systems.

| Module | Path | Python Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Simulator** | `SkyFall/simulator/` | **≥ 3.10** | Uses `NumPy`, `SciPy`; any version ≥3.10 is sufficient for numerical solvers |
| **Predictor** | `SkyFall/predictor/` | **3.x** | EKF, compatible with any modern Python 3 version |
| **Visualiser** | `SkyFall/visualisation/` | **≥ 3.10** | Uses `matplotlib`, `cartopy` (include link); tested with 3.10+ |
| **Utils** | `SkyFall/utils/` | – | Shared functions, no specific requirements |

### Package-wise dependencies

This project relies on several third-party Python packages for numerical integration, state estimation, visualisation and much more. Below is a complete list of dependencies used across all modules, along with module-specific usage notes and special considerations.

**Required Packages**

To use SkyFall, the following third-party packages are required. For the full list of required dependencies and their versions, please see `requirements.txt`. 

| Package | Purpose | Used In Modules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `numpy` | Core numerical computation, array operations | Multiple modules |
| `scipy` | ODE solver (`solve_ivp`) | `simulator`, `utils`, `visualiser` |
| `matplotlib` | Static plotting | `visualiser` |
| `tqdm` | Progress bar for loops | `visualiser`, `simulator` |
| `sympy` | Symbolic matrix construction (Jacobians) | `utils/analytical_F.py`, `utils/analytical_H.py` |

Note: built-in standard libraries such as `os`, `sys`, `datetime`, `time`, `math`, and `json` are also used across multiple modules, but do not require separate installation.

---

### 3. `Predictor.py`:

**Predictor (class)**

**process_model (function):** Obtain the prior state at time $t$, mean by passing the posterior random variable, from time $t-\Delta t$ through the ODE and a sample is taken from a Gaussian random variable, $\sim N(\vec{0},Q)$, and added to it.

- Inputs:
    - `posterior_state`: np.array
        - This is the posterior state, $\vec{x}_{t-\Delta t}$, obtained at the end of the last time’s iteration through the EKF algorithm.
    - `process_covariance`: np.array
        - This is the process covariance matrix $Q$. This is a measure of our ‘belief’ in the physics/ in the validity of the model of the dynamics.
    - `timestep`: float
        - This is the timestep used in the RK45 numerical finite difference method to transition from $\vec{x_{t}}$ to $\vec{x}_{t+\Delta t}$ through the continuous physics ODE dynamics.
    - `t`: float
        - This is the time elapsed until the last time step was taken.
    - `include_noise`: bool
        - If true, sample once from $Q$ and add to $\vec{x}_{t+\Delta t}$ else add $0$.
    - `verbose`: Bool
        - If true, print $\vec{x}_{t+\Delta t}$, else print nothing.
- Outputs:
    - `prior_state`: np.array
        - This is updated from equalling posterior, $\vec{x}*{t-\Delta t}$, to equalling the posterior passed through discretised dynamics, $\bar{x}*{t}$.

**eval_JacobianF() (function):** Leverages analytical_F.py’s access to closed-form matrix of partial derivatives, via SymPy for the continuous ODE system. Used to propagate old posterior state covariance, $P_{t-\Delta t}$, to the prior state covariance, $\bar{P}_{t}$

        - This is the previous EKF iteration’s posterior state’s covariance $P_{t-\Delta t}$, this was computed previously by evaluating $(I-K_{t-\Delta t}H_{t-\Delta t})\bar{P}*{t-\Delta t}$ where $K*{...}$ and $H_{...}$ are defined below at the current iteration, t.
    - `JacobianV` : np.array

- Outputs:
    - $\bar{P}*t := F_t \,P*{t-\Delta t}\, F_t^T + Q$, we call this the current prior state covariance matrix and it is a result of incorporating the physics model uncertainty in the previous iteration’s posterior state after it has been propagated through the current iterations’ system dynamics.

**predict_state() (function):** Uses Kalman gain matrix to combine residual with predicted prior estimate to form a mean predicted state vector and corresponding covariance matrix.

**forecast() (function):** Samples are possible from the current posterior of the predicted state vector and propagate them using a numerical method to ‘project’ the current predicted posterior on Earth’s surface.

**run_predictor() (function):** This function serves as a wrapper for running the predictor until termination, obtaining information about its estimated trajectories, impact distribution and statistics, etc. This is a user-friendly alternative to manually creating a loop for the predictor.

**Customisation Tips**

- Change Earth or model constants in `global_variables.py`.
- Edit symbolic expressions if the model dynamics are altered.

## Extending Functionality

### Custom Radar-Station Placement and Visibility

This section describes in-depth how to extend the simulator and predictor to work with user-defined, geographically specific radar stations. 

- Defining Coverage Arcs:
    - `land_arcs_deg`: List[Tuple[float,float]]
        - Each tuple `(lon_start, lon_end)` defines an interval in degrees East of the equator where stations may be placed.
        - Wrap‑around across the equator: if `lon_end < lon_start`, the interval wraps via ±180°.
        - Allocating the Radar Station Counts Proportionally:
            - Compute each arc’s angular length in degrees.
            - For each span `L`, allocate the radar stations proportionally by setting `N_i = round(N_total * L/total_length)`
            - Adjusting the rounding: by letting `delta = N_total - sum(N_i)` and by adding `delta` to the arc with the largest span.
            - Uniform Station Spacing within Arcs:
                - For each arc and its allocated count `n_i`
- Uniform Radar Station Spacing within Arcs
    - This step takes each land-arc interval and its allocated station count `n_i` and places stations at equal angular intervals along the arc. For an arc from `lo` to `hi`, compute:
    `lons = np.linspace(lo, lo + ((hi - lo) % 360), n_i)`
    - The longitudes are then normalised into the $[-180 \degree, +180 \degree)$  and converted to radians for ECI calculations.
    - For further customisability, replace the linear spacing with weighted sampling (concentrating more stations in high-risk regions).
- Visibility Half-Angle $\beta$ Calculation:
    - Assuming a maximum altitude `h_star` from which a station can still see the satellite.
    - The geometry produces: $\beta = \arccos \frac{R_E}{R_E + h_{star}}$
- Active Station Selection: `active_station`
    - This function first rotates each station’s fixed longitude into the ECI frame by accounting for Earth’s rotation, then computes the smallest signed angular separation between the satellite and each station.
    - Inputs:
        - `lon_sat`: satellite longitude (rad) in ECI frame
        - `t`: simulation time (s)
    - Outputs:
        - `idx`: index of nearest station within coverage
        - `diff`: angular offset
        

### Provision of a control input (thrust) into the predictor

This section outlines how the functionality of the predictor can be enhanced by including a control input, i.e. thrust, into the motion of the satellite. The provision of a control input enables the satellite to activate its thrust to prevent a crash landing in a populated area; such a feature has obvious merits regarding safety.

The `Predictor` class currently has existing functionality, particularly in the `update_prior_belief` function, to support the inclusion of a control input by allowing the user to specify a control covariance matrix $\mathbf{V}$. This is currently set to a default value of `None`, but can be created via the `covariance_matrix_initialiser` function found in `predictor_utils.py` and passed in.
